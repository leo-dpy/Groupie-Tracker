# EXACT COMMAND TO START SERVER

Copy and paste this ENTIRE block into PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:YT_API_KEY = "AIzaSyAHoo2BDboQafXAVfvOSfYuMmVitNhepU4"; go run .
```

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8080

## If that doesn't work, try this:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }
$env:YT_API_KEY = "AIzaSyAHoo2BDboQafXAVfvOSfYuMmVitNhepU4"
go run .
```

---

## To STOP the server:

Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal window where server is running.
